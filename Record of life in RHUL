  Today,I make an important decision to find a full-time job in UK next year.Actually，It's really a huge challenge for me but I will do my best to realize
this unrealistic dream.So I decide to record the new expertise or life skills I learned everyday from now on.Cultivating a daily introspection 
habit like this will be very helpful to success.
  life skill：The clothes and shoes in Primark have high cost performance.
              There are two very useful websites for searching various job--Targetjob & reed.
